# Introduction1

This repo contains the code for "Generative Flow Model on Distance Geometry for Predicting Transition States of Chemical Reactions" published at *Nature Communications*.

# Dataset and pretrained checkpoints

Before reproducing the results on Transition1x dataset, please download the `.h5` file in [Item - Transition1x - figshare - Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Transition1x/19614657/4?file=36035789).

The preprocessed RGD1 subset used in our work can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20179684](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20179684).

We have provided the trained checkpoints of baseline methods and our proposed TS-DFM. They can be downloaded from [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20179684](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20179684)

# Reproduction

For reproducing the results of TS-DFM, please run the Python scripts in the `Scripts` folder. The files containing hyperparameters are in the `Configs` folder.

## Mixed RGD1 + Transition1x training

The mixed-data configuration trains on all 176,898 reactions listed in the
RGD1 CSV together with the 9,561-reaction Transition1x training split. Its
validation and test sets remain the 225- and 287-reaction Transition1x splits.

First create the sharded RGD1 cache:

```bash
python Scripts/preprocess_rgd1_full.py \
  --source-zip "D:/path/to/RGD1.zip" \
  --output-dir Data/processed/rgd1_full
```

Set `data.transition1x_path` in `Configs/Dynamics_mixed.yml` to the downloaded
Transition1x HDF5 file, then start training with:

```bash
python Scripts/train_flow_matching_dist_ts1x.py \
  --config_file Configs/Dynamics_mixed.yml
```

The RGD1 CSV `dataset` column is intentionally ignored. CSV reaction IDs are
used as the full-data whitelist, while validation and testing use only the
unchanged Transition1x manifests in `Data/`.

The baseline methods are provided in the following folders:

````bash
React-OT on ts1x:react-ot-main/
React-OT on rgd1:react-ot-rgd1/
PSI-based:learnts_main/
OA-ReactDiff: OAReactDiff-main/
NeuralNEB: NeuralNEB/
